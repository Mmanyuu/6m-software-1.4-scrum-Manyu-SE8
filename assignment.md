## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
Scrum is a project management methodology within Agile that organizes work into iterations called sprints. By implementing Scrum, the project team gains clear visibility into the progress and deliverables for the school's IT infrastructure. Scrum meetings, which focus on the "Start, Stop, Continue" process, play a key role in this.

During the "Start" phase, the team identifies and initiates the sprint backlog based on user stories from the product backlog. After each sprint, the "Stop" phase involves assessing which processes or tasks are ineffective and should be discontinued. This helps the team focus on what truly contributes to the projectâ€™s goals. The "Continue" phase is where the team brainstorms and implements improvements, making adjustments to enhance effectiveness in subsequent sprints.

These iterative processes keep all team members informed and engaged, ensuring that the project evolves efficiently with continuous improvements. This approach can lead to a more effective development process and potentially even an earlier deployment of the final product.

```

Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
1. As a user, i want to be able to borrow book anywhere using this website, so that i am able to read at home.
2. As a user, i want the interface to be user-friendly, so that i can navigate the website easily.
3. As a user, i want to be able to search for the book i want to borrow, so that i dont have to find my book out of the many ones.
4. As a user, i want to be able to see the due date of the book i borrowed, so that i can know when to return the book.
5. As a user, i want to be able to see recommended books, so that i can borrow books that i might like.
6. As a user, i want to be able to know how many books i can check out at once, so that i can limit myself to that amount of books.
7. As a user, i want to be able to extend books due date, so that i can continue reading my unfinished books.
8. As a user, i want to know all the penalties i have for not returning the books, so that i can pay my due.
9. As a user, i want to put a library book on hold or bookmark it, so that i can borrow it next time.
10. As a user, i want to know if the book i want to borrow is available or not, so that i do not have to spend time searching for a book that have been borrowed by someone else.
